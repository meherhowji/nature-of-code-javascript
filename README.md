# Nature Of Code with JavaScript
Experiments with maths in JavaScript. Derived from the book: The Nature Of Code.

Currently WIP.

If you wish to load examples then you can go to the index.html file and pass the filename nature system.
For example:
    // ballBouncing is the file name and the object's configuration also
    // similarly other modules can be loaded.
    nature.beginWith(ballBouncing);
